For 3 and a half years I had constantly delayed and pushed past release dates for Derailed. In reality, I believe in the past I was quite heavily rushing making Derailed for what I knew at the time.

I started Derailed in December 2021. That feels so long ago. When Derailed was created (initially called Stancium,) I was 12 years old, and I had just started programming about 2/4 months earlier. Derailed has grown alongside me both with age and with experience. If you look at many of the open source Derailed archive repos ([for](https://github.com/derailed-archive) [any](https://github.com/decker-archive)[one](https://github.com/deckerapp) [inter](https://github.com/veneralab)[ested](https://github.com/concordchat-legacy)) you can see my code's quality increase as Derailed got older and older and I gained more experience.

I must be blunt and truthful, I don't believe anymore it was ever feasible to realistically launch Derailed before now. I had much less access to resources than I do now, and wouldn't have ever been able to place Derailed onto a domain, let alone publically host it to more than 3 users at once. I also obviously didn't have experience in running an app in production, especially one with the complexity of Derailed. Derailed only became possible for you all to use, now.

However, in a more vainful light, I believe it's well enough to admit, Derailed is just a project I cannot kill. I've tried, Derailed has been sunsetted at least 4 different times, and every time I have come back to working on Derailed again. It's a cycle I cannot break, so if I can't break it, I may as well seceed to it and finally try delivering Derailed.

I've been getting back to working on Derailed over the past week, including the rest of the team such as [Ananas](https://github.com/ananasmoe) with his direct contributions, and with others like [Spifory](https://github.com/spifory), [Elena](https://github.com/elenakrittik), and [Emma](https://github.com/EmmmaTech) helping out by giving opinions, feedback, and other useful information for Derailed.

## What will Derailed have?

At the moment, Derailed is basically WhatsApp in a Discord skin. We're still to add guilds sometime this week, but that's after
some other more important critical components or features. The most I can promise is:

- Guilds
- Guild Channels (including permission overwrites for users and roles. Only category and text channels.)
- Roles (including permissions)
- Messaging (including Guilds and DMs)
- Friends
- Private Channels (including only user-to-user)

## What will Derailed look like?

Derailed is going with a design style reminiscent to that of the 2016 Discord app. If you like the design of that app, you'll be in luck with Derailed's style.

## That's it

Yup, that's all. There's no "One more thing...", this is all I've got. See you on June 30, 2025.
