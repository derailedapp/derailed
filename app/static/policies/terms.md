# Terms of Service

Last Updated: 06/30/2025

This is the Derailed Terms of Service ("TOS, "Terms"). The TOS defines a set of legal obligations between you ("You," "Your," "The User") and Derailed ("Us," "Our") concerning your usage of the Social Media service hosted and provided by Derailed and its third-party partners ("The Service," "The Platform").

Derailed is a service operated by Vincent Jose De Chico, an individual based in the Philippines, and Dawid V., an individual based in Germany.

You must be at least 13 years old, or the minimum age required in your jurisdiction to use social media services, whichever is greater. If under the legal age, you may only use the Platform with parental or legal guardian consent.

You agree that Derailed may at any time, with or without reason, suspend, limit, or remove your account with or without warning at our discretion.

By accessing or using Derailed, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Service.

We reserve the right to update or modify these Terms at any time. Continued use of the Platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

## Content

Content on The Platform refers to a file, a text, an image, or any other data sent by a user to The Service.

When you create, upload, or send a piece of content onto Derailed's social network (content in this case should be generally referred to as "Track" or "Tracks") or onto Derailed's communication & messaging network (the content in this case generalized as "Message" or "Messages") you grant us and our third-party partners a perpetual, non-exclusive license to use that content as far as to be able to properly serve The Platform.

### Agreement of Ownership

You agree that any content you create, upload, or send on Derailed is under ownership or has the consent from the owner for your usage.

### Agreement of Moderation

You agree that any content you own on Derailed can be deleted or removed by Derailed at any time with or without reason at our discretion.

## Right to be Forgotten

We will respond to data deletion requests within 32 days. Some data may be retained for security, legal compliance, or operational integrity. Data that is not deleted will be anonymized and dissociated from your identity.

We may block your request if you are in ownership of a Derailed Community ("Guild") without having deleted or transferred said ownership before data deletion.

## Provided "As Is"

THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL DERAILED OR ITS THIRD-PARTIES BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SERVICE 

## Limitation of Liabilities

In no event shall Derailed, its officers, employees, or partners be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.
